# unit13-challenge

This repo contains the RoboAdvisor homework for week 13.

The bot used were made on Amazon Lex V1, instead of the newer V2 version. 
An Amazon lambda function was also incorporated into the RoboAdvisor bot.

The lambda function used was provided by the staff team and were not made by myself.
Thanks Claudia and Liam for that.

This exercise was chosen instead of the Crypto Clustering exercise.
